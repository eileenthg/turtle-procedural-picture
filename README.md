# turtle-procedural-picture
A turtle script to procedurally generate a slightly different picture every time it's run. 

This is done for my final Python project demonstration for my degree.

How to run:
- Download python
- Download A180693.py
- Run the python script in terminal by typing "python A180693.py" in the terminal where the downloaded file is.
- Enjoy.

* The script will draw a new painting 10 seconds after the old painting is completed.
* The script will only draw two paintings. 
* To keep drawing paintings indefinitely, go into A180693.py, scroll all the way down, and uncomment these lines.
